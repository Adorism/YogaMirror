### **What Did I Do?**
I had been working with pytorch models and stumbled across the idea that these machine learning models could be converted in such a way that they can be compatible with Javascript and loaded directly in the broswer. This means that a dynamic model can be fast, easy to host, and offer offline support. At least, that's what I learned from this video. I wanted to put it to the test by creating a small pytorch model to differentiate between several different yoga poses. This would also mean that I would need to investigate the technologies for live mirroring the pose from a webcam input. I'll get to that next. 

Take a look at [Pytorch to Javascript with ONNX GitHub](https://github.com/elliotwaite/pytorch-to-javascript-with-onnx-js) to explore more.

### **What Next?**

- Image Source: [Kaggle Yoga Pose Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/general/192938)<br>
- I used a subset of this dataset to simplify the training process and to get to working with the broswer more quickly.
